Hi welcome to the Others subfolder!
In this folder you will find 2 files, 1 folder

1. Sample [Folder]
2. csvGenerator.py
3. sqlMiscCommand.py

The Sample folder contains a sample of how the CSV would look like at different point
(scrape and clean).

The csvGenerator.py is use to generate backdated CSV from today based on a sample CSV 
provided. This helps create data for us to work with.

sqlMiscCommand.py is use to refresh the database where we delete and create the tablel
again with the URL all intact, this allows us to test the database and just refresh it
after we are done.
