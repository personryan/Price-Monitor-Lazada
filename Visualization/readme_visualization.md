Hi welcome to the Visualization subfolder!
In this folder you will find 2 files,

1. GUI.py
2. telegramBot.py

telegramBot.py is our file to run and start up the telegramBot. Our telegramBot
can be accessed at t.me/pricemonitorpy_bot or @pricemonitorpy_bot. Our bot
allows users to quickly look at the price of items and set up alerts. User
can also add new URL for tracking.

GUI.py is our application version where users can view the prices of items
in a graph format and also set up alerts for item they desired. User can also
add new URL they want to track.

GUI was only pass to Bruce at the last stretch for cleaning up of the codes.
The telegramBot.py was in charge by LayKiat and Bruce assisted in helping him
